 (19117,116,'m10p','Why, this is a treat! That\'s so nice of my friend to think of me all the way out here. Tell you what, take me back with you. That\'ll give me something to talk about down at the cantina.'),
 (19118,116,'m10t','You Must Have Me Confused'),
 (19119,116,'m10c','You brought my friend here! Now that\'s service. I didn\'t expect such thoughtfulness. Please accept this token of my great gratitude.'),

 (19139,116,'m14c','My droid, destroyed? Argh, what a nuisance. Well, thanks for rescuing my friend, at least. By rights I should only owe you half -- well, never mind, here\'s your full reward. Unless you\'d like this nice restraining bolt instead?'),
 (19140,116,'m14e','Thanks for bringing me back. I expect my friend had insurance on that droid. So don\'t worry, your reward won\'t do any lasting financial damage.'),
 (19141,116,'m15o','Some kind of military activity has stranded my employees out in the wilderness. I don\'t know the details. The distress call was garbled. Please, can you perform a rescue?'),

 (19148,116,'m16t','Going Native'),
 (19149,116,'m16c','The kids must have eaten wanderweed blooms. Now they\'re probably all convinced they\'re Shistavanen wolfmen or something. I\'ll organize a patrol.'),

 (19252,117,'m12p','My life is worth more than the lousy wage I\'m getting from this so-called chef. I didn\'t want to come out here in the first place. Why can\'t these chefs just buy herbs at the store like everyone else?'),

 (19283,117,'m18t','Mystery! Danger!'),
 (19284,117,'m18c','My friend can get lost on the way to the corner mission terminal. It\'s a chore to keep up, but I\'m glad people like you are around to do such chores.'),
 (19285,117,'m18e','I feel more relaxed now. In fact, I\'m getting hungry. I think I\'ll visit a great new place I heard about, just a few klicks outside town.'),

 (19296,117,'m21o','I\'ve found a witness to the legendary exploits of the Twi\'lek adventurer O-i. This will make my O-i documentary the sensation of HoloNet. Bring me the witness, please.'),
 (19297,117,'m21p','I saw O-i float down the central air shaft of a Tibanna gas mine, firing as he went! He landed on a maintenance platform and took out a squad of stormtroopers! And then--'),
 (19298,117,'m21t','A Tall Tale'),
 (19299,117,'m21c','I guess my friend talked your ear off the whole trip, eh? That O-i inspires fervent enthusiasm. Thank you, here\'s your fee.'),
 (19300,117,'m21e','And then O-i pulled a blaster and shot the AT-AT right in the forward sensor, blinding it. Then he climbed up on top and detached the head! You won\'t believe what happened next--'),
 (19301,117,'m22o','My buddy has worked out a scheme to clean up in the Mega-Millions Lottery on Trastino. I want in! I\'ll pay you to bring my friend here so we can work out the details.'),

 (19306,117,'m23o','The recharge processes in my power cores have gone crazy. I hired a famous specialist, who got lost on the way here. Can you play guide? I\'ll pay you. '),

 (19312,117,'m24p','Fortunately, I\'m unwounded. That anooba\'s dying scream was high and blood-curdling, but strangely satisfying, like the sound of landspeeder body welds popping as the garbage masher presses down.'),

 (19314,117,'m24c','A fine effort -- by you and the hunter both! I look forward to hearing all about the creature\'s death throes.'),

 (19325,117,'m26e','I expect only minimal fatalities from the new track. Of course, in podracing, that\'s not really a good thing.'),
 (19326,117,'m27o','I hired a researcher to place weather sensors across the landscape, but now there\'s too much equipment to carry alone. Can you offload some of the gear and bring it here?'),
 (19327,117,'m27p','I lost all my gear in a freak windstorm. The sensors probably predicted it, before they got blown away. Mind if I follow you back?'),
 (19328,117,'m27t','Help the Researcher'),
 (19329,117,'m27c','The art of weather prediction still awaits a breakthrough. Thanks anyway.'),
 (19330,117,'m27e','With an influx of capital I could plant a whole new array of sophisticated weather sensors. Interested in investing?'),
 (19331,117,'m28o','I heard rumors of a crashed meteorite nearby. The scout I hired to find it has called in, but the transmission broke up. Please go to these coordinates and find the scout.'),
 (19332,117,'m28p','I found the meteorite, or what was left of it. But residual radioactivity fried my comlink. Please take me back to my patron, and we\'ll pay you.'),
 (19333,117,'m28t','Scout for the Scout'),
 (19334,117,'m28c','Radioactive meteorite? Hmm, that could be lucrative. I\'ll send another scout. Maybe two. And some shielded droids.'),
 (19335,117,'m28e','I think this mission shortened my life. I hope you weren\'t caught in the danger zone yourself. Thanks, my patron has your fee.'),
 (19336,117,'m29o','A friend has been taking holographs of the countryside for an upcoming HoloNet release. I just got a distress call. I\'ll pay you to get out there and rescue my friend.'),

 (19342,117,'m30p','Mother. Make the hurting stop. Bright lights, no, dark, it hurts my eyes. Where am I now? You. I follow you.'),
 (19343,117,'m30t','Heart of Darkness'),
 (19344,117,'m30c','This was an ill-advised experiment in vision-questing, like the natives of some offworld cultures. I\'ll take care of my trance-walking friend. Thanks for the rescue!'),

 (19346,117,'m31o','I\'m preparing a case in a high Imperial court about the detestable conditions in the countryside. My researcher has reported in, calling for an escort. Can I hire you?'),
 (19347,117,'m31p','My employer\'s case involves deep legal principles that govern the demarcation of property. I expect this case will launch us into the legal history books!'),
 (19348,117,'m31t','Aid Legal Principles'),
 (19349,117,'m31c','Bad news. I\'ve just learned the Emperor\'s latest decree nullifies my argument. This is very bad for the Empire, I feel, but in the short term worse for my finances.'),

 (19354,117,'m32c','Uhh -- extending Wookiee lifespan? Don\'t they already live for centuries? And how much of a market is there? Looks like my fortune isn\'t yet assured (sigh).'),
 (19355,117,'m32e','Just you wait, those Wookiees will be tearing people\'s arms off to get at this chemical!'),
 (19356,117,'m33o','I\'ve had droids out prospecting for mineral deposits, and one reported a good find, but then went silent. I hired someone to fix it, and now this person has just called, asking for an escort. Argh! Can you pick up my lost mechanic?'),
 (19357,117,'m33p','The droid\'s direction finders blew out, apparently in response to local radioactivity. I have its data records here, but I want an escort in case I get ambushed by greedy claim-jumpers.'),
 (19358,117,'m33t','Protect the Find'),
 (19359,117,'m33c','Hmm. Radioactivity! That might mean -- hmm. Yes. Well, in any case, here is your fee, goodbye.'),
 (19360,117,'m33e','If I were you, I\'d think about buying land somewhere around that area. You never know when it might become valuable. Thanks for the escort.'),
 (19361,117,'m34o','My neighbor, a cruel savage, drove my purebred pet greysor out into the wilderness. I forced the barbarian to track it down and rescue it. But now it seems the rescuer needs rescuing, too. Can I trust you to bring back my greysor, and incidentally the fiend who drove it away?'),
 (19362,117,'m34p','I found the animal, but it was kind of, uh, eaten. Partly eaten. Can you take me back now?'),
 (19363,117,'m34t','Poor Little Greysor'),
 (19364,117,'m34c','This beast in sentient form has destroyed my beloved Whotti! Mark me, there will be a reckoning. To start with, this scoundrel will pay your rescue fee.'),

 (19367,117,'m35p','Oh, you found my patient! I\'m afraid I\'m a better psychiatrist than I am a jailkeeper. Can you take me there? This delusion about derring-do has caused me no end of trouble.'),

 (19371,117,'m36o','Maybe you can help me. I just bought an R2 unit, but the darn thing won\'t listen to anyone but its former owner. I can\'t afford to have its memory flushed. Can you fetch the person who sold it to me so I can get it to obey me now?'),
 (19372,117,'m36p','My old R2 unit is still acting up, eh? That little droid has caused me a lot of trouble. I\'ll see what I can do.'),

 (19374,117,'m36c','I sure hope we can set that little droid straight. I\'m about ready to blast it into a million pieces.'),
 (19375,117,'m36e','I\'ll see if I can convince my old R2 unit to obey its new master. These older-model astro-droids can get out of hand.'),
 (19376,117,'m37o','A reporter from the local newsfeed is interviewing me today, but to discourage eavesdroppers I\'ve arranged for a secret meeting. I need you to bring the reporter back here. If anyone tries to follow you, see if you can lose them.'),

 (19425,117,'m46e','I think this episode indicates a fundamental disconnect in my management style. Maybe I\'ll hire a consultant to advise on how to open lines of communication.'),
 (19426,117,'m47o','I got home and found that my roommate has gone out into the wilderness. Why? The note didn\'t say. It\'s unlike my roomie to do this, so could you go out and check what\'s going on?'),
